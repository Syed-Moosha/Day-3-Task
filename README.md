1) I have compared JSON which has same properties without order using stringify and for in loop and also compared using sort function 
a. let obj1 = {name:"Persaon 1", age:5};
a. let obj1 = {age:5, name:"Persaon 1"};
2) Display all the country flags in the console
3) Print all countries name, regions, sub-region and populations
